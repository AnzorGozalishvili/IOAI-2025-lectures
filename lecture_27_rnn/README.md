## Environment Setup

To set up the development environment for this project, follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

This will install all required packages including PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning with their appropriate versions.

Note: Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system before setting up the environment.
